    "### Background and Prior Work \n",
    "\n",
    "Housing prices in Los Angeles are influenced by multiple economic, social, and environmental factors. Characteristics such as income levels, proximity to major cities, and the proximity to the ocean[1] are known to have an impact on the value of a home, as these factors can be seen as appealing to buyers. Having such features in a house can make a neighborhood seem more appealing and attractive to the residents, leading to a higher demand and an increase in housing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies based on the housing market in Los Angeles have emphasized how the proximity to the ocean contributes to higher home values due to the unique views and lifestyle it provides[2]. In addition, neighborhood income levels and home sizes are playing a big role in property values, as higher income neighborhoods with larger homes attract buyers who will pay at a higher price for such features. Our work will build on this research by focusing on which factors are the best features that create high-value housing in Los Angeles. Our analysis will provide a detailed understanding of the interactions between economic, demographic, and geographic factors in the Los Angeles housing market.\n",

    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We predict that high-value housing in Los Angeles will be best characterized by a combination of higher income, a greater total number of bedrooms, and closer proximity to the ocean. Higher average income levels may correlate with higher home values as greater income enables residents to afford more expensive homes, while a greater total number of bedrooms could be indicative of larger more spacious houses. \n",
    "Proximity to the ocean is a highly desirable feature, often associated with premium real estate prices due to the scenic views. Specifics, like what kind of water body and exactly how close houses are to the water, may have varying levels of impact on home values, but have an overall positive affect. That said, flood zones on rivers and lakes lower values slightly but the impact of the water is overall positive[1].\n",
    "Additionally, we believe that there may be a relationship between income and house price, not only because higher income may enable people to afford more expensive homes, but also because a 2020 study of absolute income inequality and rising house prices showed that “...increasing income inequality contributed to the rise in real house prices.”[2]\n",
    "Lastly, the link between number of bedrooms and house price has historically been linked with higher home appraisal values. There are two reasons for this, the first being that more bedrooms often indicates higher square footage, however, even two equally sized homes, will be appraised differently if one has more bedrooms than the other[3]. In fact, the number of rooms tends to impact house price at a significantly higher rate than other factors[4].\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset that our team has chosen to use is the “California Housing with Name of Counties” dataset, which is available on Kaggle. This dataset provides comprehensive information on housing prices across various California counties. It includes a total of 20,640 observations and features a total of 10 variables, making it a robust dataset for analyzing housing trends and factors influencing housing prices. The data includes information from the 1990 California census, and includes variables such as median house value, median income, median housing age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, longitude, and the name of the county.  This dataset is particularly useful for understanding the geographic and socioeconomic factors affecting housing prices in California.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given our research question, “What combination of factors best characterizes high-value housing in Los Angeles?”, we will focus on the following steps to prepare our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Filtering for Los Angeles\n",
    "We plan to extract data specific to Los Angeles county from the dataset to ensure that our analysis is geographically relevant. This will narrow the number of observations that we work with from 20,640 to 5,836.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Defining High-Value Housing\n",
    "Since we are focusing on factors that characterize high-value homes, we will only look at the top 50% of homes in terms of median_house_value. This further narrows the dataset from 5,836 to 2,918. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Feature Engineering\n",
    "May create new features if necessary, or helpful. For example, average of people living in each household by dividing Population by Households. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Normalize\n",
    "Normalize numerical values to ensure they are on a similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Encode\n",
    "Encode categorical variables into numerical format to facilitate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Missing Values\n",
    "Removing or imputing any null or missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Other\n",
    "These wrangling methods are tentative, we may use fewer or additional methods if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these steps, we can ensure that our dataset is clean and relevant, allowing us to analyze specific combinations of factors to see if/how they impact high-value housing in Los Angeles. This approach ensures that our analysis is both comprehensive and targeted, providing meaningful insights into our research question. \n"

    "The data set we used is based on a Kaggle data set. The data set was substantial and did not contain any personal or private information from its listings, therefore breach of privacy was not a concern. The information used in the data set is based on the 1990 California Census.  All of the data shown on this is information available to the public therefore the concern of violating any privacy terms would not be a problem. The California Census pulls data from the The U.S. Census Bureau which is information updated every 10 years therefore there should be no bias in the data as it is accurate and public information.

    "Our team will prioritize effective communication and a collaborative tone to keep everything on track. For daily communication, we’ll use iMessage, with responses expected within 2–3 hours to keep things moving smoothly. Weekly virtual meetings on Mondays will help us stay aligned and troubleshoot any issues. We’ll aim for a tone that’s \"blunt but polite,\" encouraging open feedback with a focus on solutions. For example, we’ll phrase criticism constructively: \"I think X is a problem because of Y. Does everyone else agree, or am I missing something?\" Major project decisions will require a unanimous vote, while smaller, section-specific ones will follow a majority rule, allowing for flexibility if someone is unavailable. Our work style will be balanced; while we’ll all contribute equally at first, as we progress, team members can focus on areas where they excel. If anyone is struggling with their tasks, they should notify the group immediately via the group chat. In these cases, we’ll divide responsibilities to ensure we meet our shared deadlines, which will generally be set for noon on the due date. Additionally, team members are expected to track task progress using the Google spreadsheet\n",
